    <h2 id="beg">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
            human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a
        policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be
        just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower
        who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human
        being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
