            <p><i><b>This</i></b> might be an interesting story all by itself. A little Indian boy teaches himself to
                read at an
                early age and advances quickly. He reads "Grapes of Wrath" in kindergarten when other
                children are struggling through "Dick and Jane." If he'd been anything but an Indian boy living on
                the reservation, he might have been called a prodigy. But he is an Indian boy living on the
                reservation and is simply an oddity.
                <br><br> He grows into a man who often speaks of his childhood in
                the third-person, as if it will somehow dull the pain and make him sound more modest about his
                talents.
                <br><br>
                A smart Indian is a dangerous person, widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non- Indians
                alike. I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the nonIndian
                teacher asked for answers, for volunteers, for help. We were Indian children who were
                expected to be stupid. Most lived up to those expectations inside the classroom but subverted
                on the outside. They struggled with basic reading in school but could remember how to sing a
                few dozen pow wow songs.
                <br><br> They were monosyllabic in front of their non-Indian teachers but
                could tell complicated stories and jokes at the dinner table. They submissively ducked their
                heads when confronted by a non-Indian adult but would slug it out with the Indian bully who was
                ten years older. As Indian children, we were expected to fail in the non-Indian world. Those who
                failed were ceremonially accepted by other Indians and appropriately pitied by non-Indians.
                <br><br>
                I refused to fail. I was smart. I was arrogant. I was lucky. I read books late into the night, until I
                could barely keep my eyes open. I read books at recess, then during lunch, and in the few
                minutes left after I had finished my classroom assignments. I read books in the car when my
                family traveled to powwows or basketball games. In shopping malls, I ran to the bookstores and
                read bits and pieces of as many books as I could.
                <br><br>I read the books my father brought home from
                the pawnshops and secondhand. I read the books I borrowed from the library. I read the backs
                of cereal boxes. I read the newspaper. I read the bulletins posted on the walls of the school, the
                clinic, the tribal offices, the post office. I read junk mail. I read auto-repair manuals. I read
                magazines...
